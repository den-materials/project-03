For Project 3, you will be working in groups of 3 or 4 to build a SEAN-stack application.

Everyone will pitch an idea for Project 3. After hearing the pitches, you'll rank the ideas in order of preference. We'll use these preferences to pick the three project ideas and put together the groups.

**When you pitch to the class, please follow these guidelines:**

1. Keep it VERY brief (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch" target="_blank">elevator pitch</a>). Your pitch cannot exceed 3 minutes.
2. Answer these questions:
  * What is your idea?
  * Who is it for, and why do they need it?
  * What technologies would you use that we haven't covered in class (if any)?
  * What can you do better than your competition? What makes your app special?
3. You should use findings from user research to help answer the questions above.
4. Draw up the idea of your app, and any accompanying visuals, but NO SLIDES. You will have 30 seconds to prepare the whiteboard with any visuals you need.
